# Commerce Razor Demo
Hello,

This project is a commerce website demo built as a example of my full stack development skillset. The site with built with ASP.NET Razor Pages, and uses postback and the full page lifecycle, with minimal javascript (for some client side validation). 

This site is running at (http://commercerazordemo.azurewebsites.net)

## Assumptions
Users do not log in or register, but the site does use Identity. By default you will be logged in as a customer (Jerry). Switching the user is done by the dropdown selection in the site footer. 

All products amd orders are of course, fictional. Customers my search and put items into their cart, and place the order. The administrator user can process orders (ship, deliver, return) as well as update products and add customers. 

There are no product images, they are being represented by dummy image that just display the dimensions.

This site is developed for a full screen (1920) view. It may be revised for mobile viewing as time goes by.
